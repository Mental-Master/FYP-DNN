# FYP-DNN
This is the DNN model code of Guandong Yang's FYP project of XJTLU.

## Brief Introduction
For ease of use, I have separated the code for each floor, and each floor has a folder that contains the datasets for that floor, including training and test sets, as well as a small split training set.
The code for the DNN classification model is stored in a folder with the DNN-C suffix, named DNN-C, where the DNN-C folder holds the predictions of the trained model.
The code for the DNN regression model is stored in a folder with the DNN-R suffix, named DNN-R, where the DNN-R folder holds the predictions of the trained model.
The code for stage-wise training framework is stored in a folder on each floor, named Stage-wise, where the Stage-wise folder holds the predictions of the trained model.
